### Step 1: Dataset Exploration
- Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and the relationship between features and house prices.

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Leveraged domain knowledge to engineer new features that capture underlying aspects of the data not immediately apparent from the original dataset.
  
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select the most relevant features, reducing the complexity of the model while retaining essential information.
### Step 3: Model Building
- Developed three distinct models to predict house prices, evaluating their performance to select the best-performing model.

### Step 4: Model Tuning
- Utilized GridSearch to fine-tune the models' hyperparameters, ensuring optimal performance.
- Streamlined the workflow by integrating preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling steps into a cohesive pipeline.
